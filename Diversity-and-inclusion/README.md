#  Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard 

Welcome to this diversity and inclusion analysis project using Power BI. This interactive dashboard was designed in response to a challenge faced by a company in the telecommunications sector: improving gender balance at executive management level and promoting an inclusive working environment.


<h2> Context </h2>

As part of an assignment for a client in the telecommunications sector, we developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyse diversity and inclusion within the company. The main aim of the project was to support efforts to improve gender balance, particularly at executive management level.

<h2> Issues </h2>

Although the company has a number of initiatives in place to promote diversity and inclusion, limited progress has been made in achieving gender balance at senior management level. Through this project, we sought to provide analytical tools to assess existing gaps and help the company adjust its strategies.

<h2> Project objectives </h2>

1.	Analyse demographic data to measure diversity within the company.
2.	Assess recruitment, promotion and rotation processes to identify areas for improvement.
3.	Provide key performance indicators (KPIs) to support strategic decision-making on diversity and inclusion.

<h2> Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) </h2>

Here are the main indicators calculated and monitored in this project, enabling the impact of diversity and inclusion initiatives to be measured:

1. Workforce breakdown

	- Total number of employees: 500
	- Gender breakdown :
	- 59% Men (295 employees)
	- 41% Women (205 employees)
This highlights an overall imbalance, with a higher proportion of men. The aim is to achieve parity between men and women in the coming years.
	- Age distribution:
	- 20-29 years: 24
	- 30-39 years: 53% (majority group)
	- 40-49 year olds: 15% (majority group)
	- 50-59 year olds: 7% (majority group)
	- 60-69 years old: 1%.
The average age of employees is in the 30-39 bracket, which could influence talent management and promotions.

2. Promotions and Career Growth

	- % of employees promoted (FY21):
	- 24.88% of women were promoted.
	- 17.29% of men were promoted.
This shows a higher promotion rate for women, which is a positive indicator of efforts to reduce gender gaps in career opportunities.
	- % of women promoted: Particular attention has been paid to the promotion of women, with efforts to break the glass ceiling at management level.


3.  Staff turnover

	- Turnover rate :
	- 50% turnover among employees aged 50-59.
The high attrition rate in this age group requires appropriate retention measures to maintain expertise within the organisation.
	- Turnover by department: The departments with the highest turnover rates include finance and strategy, indicating that these departments need to be particularly monitored to avoid the loss of critical talent.

4. Employee performance

	- Average performance score FY20 :
	- Women: 2.42
	- Men: 2.41
Performance is broadly equivalent between men and women, which is a good sign of fairness in employee appraisal.
