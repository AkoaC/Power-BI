## Hypotheses and Recommendations

1. **Attrition in the critical age bracket (26-35)** :
- Implement targeted retention initiatives for this age group.

2. **Attrition in the marketing department** :
- Analyse the underlying causes and adopt measures to improve satisfaction and career prospects.

3. **Job satisfaction by role** :
- Monitor roles with potentially low satisfaction levels, such as production managers.

4. **Marital status diversity** :
- Tailor benefits, such as parental leave or flexible policies, to employees' needs (married, single, divorced).
