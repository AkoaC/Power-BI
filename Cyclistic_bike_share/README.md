## Project : Cyclistic bike share

<p> This project analyzes data from Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago, with the goal of developing a data-driven marketing strategy. The objective is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic's bikes differently and provide recommendations to convert more casual riders into annual members. </br>
